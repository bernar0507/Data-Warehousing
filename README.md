Project of Data Warehousing

# What is this?
This is a repository with a project developed in the curricular unit Data Warehousing during my Bioinformatics degree.
The project is divided into 3 parts. 
The 1st part was about designing Bus matrix and priority matrix.
The 2nd part was about the ETL process.
The 3rd part was about analysis services.
The zip file has all the project inside, including the report of the project.

# What I've learned?
With this project developed in the curricular unit Data Warehousing during my Bioinformatics degree, I've acquired basic about Microsoft 
excel and visual studio, designing Bus matrix, priority matrix, ETL process, analysis services.
I hope this can be useful for a near future.
